## Before you begin..
Congratulations on choosing to go down the rabbit  hole that is cybersecurity. This roadmap, although it focuses on Cybersecurity in general, is currently aimed highly towards Penetration testing. Please bear that in mind as you navigate through the roadmap. There are several other professions in the field of cybersecurity.

> Energy and Persistence conquer all things

Now, remember that good things take time. This roadmap has been very carefully curated to cover the most important topics in cybersecurity in general and penetration testing in specific. If at all it feels overwhelming during the progression, relax a bit and get back. Your hardwork will definitely pay off!

Make sure you put this knowledge to lawful use. Any deviations would lead to severe punishments. 


## Pre-requisites
Before you move forward with the roadmap, It is highly recommended that you enroll in the following course - [Zero to Mastery: Complete Ethical Hacking Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ethical-hacking-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/) on Udemy. This is a beginner friendly course that costs less than a pizza, and contains everything one would need to get their hands dirty with penetration testing. 

**Alternative Free Resources:**
- [freeCodeCamp: Ethical Hacking Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE)
- [Cybrary: Introduction to IT & Cybersecurity](https://www.cybrary.it/course/introduction-to-it-and-cybersecurity/)

## Note Taking
Taking notes can be a very effective way to organize and consolidate your learning during your preparation to become a penetration tester. 
Using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to take notes during your preparation is highly recommended. 

**Alternative Note-Taking Tools:**
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)

## Programming
Programming is an indispensable skill when it comes to Penetration Testing and Cybersecurity in general. However, one could do with just basic programming skills and good logic. To make sure you hone your programming skills, practice programming concepts whenever you can during the prescribed 100 day roadmap. How you fit programming into your schedule is entirely up to you.

Python is highly recommended for beginners. The course recommended under the Pre-requisites section has a really good Python Programming module one could follow.

**Additional Programming Resources:**
- [Python.org Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

## Day 1:

**PTES:**
The penetration testing execution standard consists of seven (7) main sections. These cover everything related to a penetration test - from the initial communication and reasoning behind a pentest, through the intelligence gathering and threat modeling phases where testers are working behind the scenes in order to get a better understanding of the tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and post exploitation.
