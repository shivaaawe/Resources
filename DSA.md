## 💯 About #100DaysOfDSA
This is a 100-day bootcamp for freshers and anyone who wishes to master **Data Structures & Algorithms** with:
- A clear roadmap  
- Curated resources  
- Daily assignments  
- Milestones with mini-projects  
- Guidance & practice  

> ⚡ Consistency beats intensity. Solve daily, practice daily, and track your progress.

## 📌 Structure
We’ve divided the 100 days into **4 milestones**.  
Each milestone concludes with **revision + mini-projects** to strengthen learning.  

- **Milestone 1** → Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists  
- **Milestone 2** → Stacks, Queues, Recursion & Trees  
- **Milestone 3** → BST, Heaps, Graphs  
- **Milestone 4** → Dynamic Programming, Advanced Topics, Final Projects  

Additionally, there are **two assignments**:  
- **Mid-Course Assignment (Day 50)**  
- **Final Assignment (Day 100)**
